# vkQuake_launcher
A simple launcher for vkquake
The launcher will requiere wxPython to run. vkQuake already have a mods menu, but game names was missing. Since I wanted to run the new release in linux vkquake I simple create a launcher.
Arcane Dimensions was downloaded from mod db and it's folder renamed to ad.
